===========

Simple computation can be directly written using the GPU (no Cuda, no OpenCL):


* `game-of-life.py <https://github.com/glumpy/glumpy/blob/master/examples/game-of-life.py>`_

  This is the Game Of Life computed on the GPU (very fast).

* `grayscott.py <https://github.com/glumpy/glumpy/blob/master/examples/grayscott.py>`_

  This is a Grayscott Reaction-Diffusion system.


* `smoke.py <https://github.com/glumpy/glumpy/blob/master/examples/smoke/smoke.py>`_

  This is smoke simulation ported from the `little grasshopper <http://prideout.net/blog/?p=58>`_.
